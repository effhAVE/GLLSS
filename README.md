Purpose of the site is to help staff, especially hosts and teamleaders of GLL to make schedule for them when to work as the main aspect. They can put their availability for certain tournaments and then being scheduled. Site offers as well more functionalities to ease the work. There are several roles to divide people based on their position. We will look into each role and describe the site, functionalities and possibilities within each role.

## Roles

- Uncomfirmed User
- Guest
- Host
- TeamLeader
- Admin
- MasterAdmin

### Unconfirmed User
First thing first, to access the site a person has to register. On the image shown, it can be seen how the login page looks like.

Once you do fill all the information and you wil ltry to log in, you will see the site will not allow it and will throw an error.

List of current admins is generated by database of users who have admin or masteradmin role. You cannot access any other part of the site, if you will try to type something into URL then you will get information of revoked Access and **Error 403**, the button for returning back will be shown too. If on other hand you will try to type a site which does not exist, you will get an **Error 404**. You can only Log Out by button on top right corner, which will log you out.

#### Hosting Guide
Hosting Guide is a step by step guide for hosts how to host each game individually, it is a link to google document which on clicking opens in new wwindow. Plan is to move teh guide to be editable on to the page. 

#### Teamkills Script
It is a script, which looks at the Teamkill Value of PUBG games through their API. GLL site does not have the teamkills fixed while scoring through API and this is easy tool to correct the teamkills if there are any. Script will always show the right amount of kills which person should have. To make it work you have to paste the full match ID from PUBG and click on search. 

![TeamKills Script](https://i.imgur.com/jMxJB0j.png)

#### Tournaments - Overview
This is where we start with main functionalities of the site. As the host you want to host specific tournaments, and on this page you have all upcoming/running tournaments and past tournaments. It looks like on the picture and we will go through each point.

Now we will move if you click on any of the tournaments names. 

#### Tournaments - Specific Tournament

Icons can be:
- Green - Person did click Ready

You can as well see some numbers next to hosts/teamleads. If the numbers are for hosts, it is the additional or revoked rounds for specific Host, so on Example Picture Leodaddy has +4. Means he did host 2 and as well 4 more so at the end it is 6 rounds. 
Then when it comes to TeamLeads, it is specifying time. So Towby did lead 60 minutes less then he was supposed to. 

Last part what you can do as a host on Tournament Page is clicking Ready, which is next to your name. But Ready button only displays one hour before the tournament and becomes unavailable 30 minutes before. It is a check-in for hosts to see if they are ready within speicifc timeframe before the tournament.

#### Calendar
Calendar is a week based overview of all the rounds in a compact way, so you have better overview of the tournaments, rounds, hosting. On the top right the week in the year is shown and you can click on it to choose any week to see schedule for the chosen week as shown in the picture and it will display only the chosen week from Monday to Sunday. You have to click on OK once you select a week for change to happen.

You can choose once you select a week which type of tournaments you would like to see. You can choose Specific Games or keep it at All. Overview of the rounds per week is separated first by games and ordered by UTC order start time. To determine in which day the round will display. System is looking into regions and each round is part of the tournament which is in specific region. Each region has its offset value from UTC, which is converted then to Tournament Region Local Start Time. And if this Tournament Region Local Start Time lies in a day, it will show for that day. Can be seen on picture below. 

![Calendar showing matches](https://i.imgur.com/PE4BjyN.png)

As can be seen it is the compact view where first it displays the Tournament name, where clicking would go to tournament page. Under is Round name displayed. And the third row shows your local start time of the tournament and **BO** stands for Best Of to display how many rounds are played. Then it shows Hosts and TeamLeads. 
In front of Hosts you can see Group Number depending on the game, so you know which group you are actually hosting depending on game. As well Round Balance or Time Balance is displayed here and you can see in Example that Leodaddy has +4 more rounds. Each day per game will have as well its own scrollable bar, if there are too many rounds in one day.

![Lost Hosting not Displayed](https://i.imgur.com/76V3oIZ.png)

This view does not display Lost hosting as we can see, where Maya did loose hosting, but in Calendar is not displayed. Calendar only shows people who either did host/lead or are scheduled to host/lead. As the last part to mention in Calendar is whenever you are chosen to host, you will be displayed with yellow person icon and yellow text color, to easier find yourself. 

![User Hosting](https://i.imgur.com/GNmprLU.png)

#### Data
This section is to display total values for Hosting/Leading, additional stats per games and more. First you have to choose in which Month Period you want to look into Data.

![Month Period](https://i.imgur.com/eNvjise.png)

This is computed based on how much time did Leader have to spend when leading a tournament or tournaments, where if leading several tournaments at the same time are excluded since it is looking into possible collisions of time where Time Balance and Preparation Time for TeamLeaders is considered. Preparation ttime is the value for the round in minutes, which teamleader has to prepare before tournament starts.

#### Overview 
The last past for the host is the Overview, where user can see, what is he/she going to host or lead. There are some useful links, which are commonly used to have them in one place and not around. 

![Overview](https://i.imgur.com/FGyn3Pa.png)
  
In the **Upcoming tournaments** you can see all the tournaments, which are active and you are either hosting or leading. **Starts** shows for both Rounds and Tournament in which time the tournament or round will start. **Role** can be either host or teamlead. **Ready** is the same as in Tournaments. You can be ready from the overview. Ready will stay grey, until it is one hour before, then it will turn Red and will become clickable, once you click it it will be green. If you miss the 30 mins ready check-in window. It will become grey again and unclickable. 
Default limit of upcoming tournaments is 5 and there is Load More button if you need to see more tournaments. 

On the top there is a scrollable button to Show Past Tournaments. On default it is turned off, but if you turn it on, then you can see simplified version of Past tournaments.   
  
![Past Tournaments](https://i.imgur.com/mB3PfMI.png)

### TeamLeader
TeamLeader is a role above Host. TeamLeader takes care of running tournaments smooth, preparing tournaments and taking support. There are not many differences between host and teamleader when it comes to application. Main difference is to be able to schedule people. Only changes between host and teamlead will be shown. 

![Menu Items](https://i.imgur.com/73LvAyD.png)

#### Overview 
Difference here is that Useful Links now contains some more links for Teamleaders. TeamLeaders as well have to check-in before, so even hosts can see that teamleader is ready. 

![Useful Links TL](https://i.imgur.com/LXz3Mgu.png)

#### Tournaments - Specific Tournament 
First changes comes in specific tournaments, where teamleader can now add/remove hosts/leads from the rounds. 

![Tournaments - Hosts/TLs](https://i.imgur.com/LoGUli8.png)

As can be seen, now it looks a little different. Left button with skull next to the host will remove the host from the round. Green button will show you possibility to add a person or lead which selected their availability for the tournament. If there is no one available message No available host will show, if choosing for teamleaders No available teamleaders. You can as well click on any user which is already selected to replace the user with another user from availability list. 

![Tournaments - Hosts/TLs - changes](https://i.imgur.com/MJBiohj.png)

Last thing which is possible here is to click on pencil, here you can change if person did loose hosting or had a difference in rounds so you can add or remove rounds. If it is a teamleader you are adding or removing amount of time.

![Choosing Hosts](https://i.imgur.com/91rC8XI.png) ![Pencil](https://i.imgur.com/5SBwTlE.png) ![Pencil - TLs](https://i.imgur.com/2JqA3Y4.png)

![Round balance](https://i.imgur.com/ZqrRqMZ.png) ![Lost Hosting](https://i.imgur.com/lCmjn3v.png)

If you do any changes you will need to confirm it by prompt notification on bottom right to Save the changes. 

![Confirm changes](https://i.imgur.com/HKzyp4t.png)

When it comes to availability, if host choose that it is available then it will appear only in Hosts, but if teamleader will choose availability, can be chosen both as host or teamlead, but if choosing one of those, then it cannot be chosen for second role. You either host or if you lead, you can host as well, but cannot be counted as extra. Sometimes it can happen, that at the end you needed someone who had not availability choosen, so for past tournaments, you can choose any host/teamleader either for hosting or leading. 

![Choosing in past Tournaments](https://i.imgur.com/z0xsj0e.png)

#### Schedule
This is a new item for teamleaders. The purpose of schedule is to make a compact way of schedulling people around as either hosts or Teamleas. Basic Overview is similar Overviews as Calendar, but now you have possibilities as in Tournaments so you can add/remove, edit Round Balance/Time Balance, and so on. 

![Schedule Overview](https://i.imgur.com/fItOrX7.png)

As can be seen it looks very similar to calendar, but with editing features. You can choose All or any game as you want. Round overview is exactly the same as in Calendar and Editing has all the features as in Tournaments.
Selecting a week now, has only 3 options and those are Current/Previous or Next. It is because when it comes to schedulling those 3 weeks are most important for changes. Previous week is there to check that everything was done properly, but should not have changes to be done. Current week can change based on hosts needed and Next week is there to schedule people for next week.

![Select week](https://i.imgur.com/G3ktFlW.png)

To determine, who is available at which time, you can click on yellow Availability icon on bottom left. which will show all the hosts and leads with their availability. Availability will not show if person is already selected for hosting/leading. From this overview you can easier determine, how you want to put hosts around. 

![Availability Table](https://i.imgur.com/uydjs7F.png)

On the top you can see Tournament Names, and then Rounds. Hosts/Leads are ordered by alphabetical order. **X** stands for available. Tournaments are ordered in the same way, how they are showned on Schedule site page. Availability Table will be displayed based on week selected. 

Last Part in this is another Tab called **Balance** as can be seen on picture below.

![Balance](https://i.imgur.com/NUIOWlM.png)

Balance will show as Availabity table for week selected. It is divided into games, because hosts are being balanced per game individually. Current week value is computed as how many times person in teh current week is selected and timed with Best of per round where person is selected. So if computing Value for Apex is 40 and Round is Best Of 8, then total value is 8*40 = 320. Rounds which are in Tournaments, which have property of Not Counted by Rounds off, are not counted in this balance. Those tournaments are special and are added as extra.

Lost Hosting is a value where person did lost hosting, so he can be compensated. Lost Hosting is from previous week. Because if you loose hosting this week, then you cannot be compensated this week, since schedule is being done for whole next week. Lost hosting happens if person was ready, but unfortunately group he was supposed to host, did not happen. Then teamleader can mark the person who lost hosting by checking lost hosting property and the amount which would be computed goes to next week lost hosting to be compensated.

Difference is computed as `Current week value - Lost Hosting (from previous week)`.

### Admin
Admin is a role above the teamlead. It is a user which has more right now and access as well for changing tournaments, rounds or users. User is responsible for correctness of these information before teamleaders and hosts have access to them. Menu items now include Admin, which have several subitems.

- Recurrence - Can be daily or weekly and by choosing one of those 2, then names are generated based on different criterias which were already described before, but will be described here too.

When choosing Start or End Date, Calendar will show up, where you have to first choose the date, then it will jump to an hour. Here make sure you are on correct time by AM or PM on bottom right and left. After hour is selected you can select minutes too. All the time here is displayed in UTC. So you need to take case when you are creating the tournament start and end date. Once you are ok with time, click on **Save**. If it saved, time will be shown on page in UTC time too. 

![Edit - Date](https://i.imgur.com/bcIK8slm.png) ![Edit - Hour](https://i.imgur.com/UwSE1PKm.png) ![Edit - Time](https://i.imgur.com/Oh5EKbwm.png)

Game list is a list of all available games at the moment, to specify it - PUBG, Apex, Autochess, PUBG Mobile.

![List of Games](https://i.imgur.com/PrtMLC5.png)

Recurrence can be either weekly or daily and based on what you choose then tournaments will be generated as follows:
- daily - Tournaments are happening several times in the week, the name of the tournaments then is generated as `#WN DDD Series Name` - where WN is Week Number and DDD day of the week in at first three letters
- weekly - Tournaments happen at most once a week. The name is then generated as follows `#WN Series Name` - where WN is a week number.

![List of Recurrence](https://i.imgur.com/sSAS6MO.png)

Region is to choose a region in which tournament is held in. Each region has its own UTC Offset too, as an example Americas Region has the UTC offset of value -4 . This offset is really important to determine the tournament and then as well rounds in the tournament, in which counting day they are happening. Even if Americas would start past midnight UTC on Monday, so UTC time would be Tuesday, because of that offset they will still be displayed in Monday and counted on the date of Monday.

![List of Regions](https://i.imgur.com/PFeehQ2.png)

At the end name has to be specified too. And once all is selected, then as an example this is how the series can be called. Only thing left to do is hitting the **Save** button and you will be redirected to series page.

All the fields will have to be filled except the Admin Page URL, which does not need to be filled, if the tournament is not yet on admin page, but it is known to happen and official for hosts to be created. Fields works the same as in Series creation, so only difference will be explained.

![Create a tournament](https://i.imgur.com/GJR7MXf.png)

- Name - This is the name of the tournament. 
- Series - List of Series. They are ordered by creation, where latest one will be on the bottom. 
- Start Date - Start date of the tournament in UTC time. By default it will show next full hour of the current date. You can click on it to edit it. 
- End Date - End date of the ttournament in UTC time. By default it will be set to plus 8 hours from the start date. You can click on it to edit it, end date has to be later than the start date. 
- Game - List of available games. 
- Region - List of available regions.
- Counted by Rounds - This a parameter, which defines if each round of the tournament is counted by Tournament Round Local Start Date or every round will be counted by end time of the tournament. Some tournaments are considered as bigger projects and are paid after the project is finished. This only influences in which month it will count for Data. By default it will be selected, meaning each round will count by Tournament Round Local Start Date.

If you select the series then Name, Game and Region will not be possible to edit, because those will be inherited from the series.

#### Data
In Data as an admin you have 2 more buttons on top right: **(Re)Calculate** and **Download Logs**. 

![Admin - Data buttons](https://i.imgur.com/bRPDqXF.png)

Clicking on (Re)Calculate will open a window, where you can edit all the values per game and as well value for Teamleads. Value for Teamleads is the amount of expenses per one hour of work. And amount per Game is costs per 1 Round in specific game. Calculation does not happen automatically, so admin has to recalculate after each week when hosts did change or schedule per week is done. To confirm green button **Calculate** has to be pressed. Calculation can take up to few seconds.

After you do calculation, you can check the logs by downloading them and you can see step by step how calculation was done. You can see especially for teamleaders, how are collisions handled. Full explanation was already mentioned in Data part for Hosts, how the stuff is calculated. On the picture you can see small part of the log.

Clicking on Edit Series will give you option to edit all the parameters for the series, when you had been creating them.

Clicking on Edit will give you back to editinf the tournament. If the tournament is in series, then you can edit only parameters you could edit, when creating a tournament, but option to rename will be there now. If tournament is not in series, you can edit all the fields. Time is here displayed in UTC as in all editing stuff.

Deleting will now work any time and you will always get second prompt window before hitting delete button, because this action cannot be undone too.

If tournament has all the correct values then rounds needs to be added into the tournament. Clicking on Add Round button will show another window with these values:
- Name - Name of the round.
- Start Date: Start date of the round in UTC time. By dafault it will be start date of the tournament.
- End Date: End date of the round in UTC time. By dafault it will be end date of the tournament.
- Best Of: Amount of rounds played in specific round. Basically how many games a host will need to host. 
- Preparation time: This is required time for TeamLeaders for the round to prepare the tournament before the start. If as an example there would be 30 as 30 minutes, that means that TeamLeader have to be here 30 mins before the start to prepare the tournament on GLL site and as well handle support before. This time is counted for computing the amount of expenses.

![Tournaments - Round Creation](https://i.imgur.com/uJsa0H7.png)

If you click on Save button, round to the tournament will be added. If you will do new round, then rounds will get sorted by Start time of the rounds, even if you edit the round after, it will automatically sort them by start time. 
By adding round to the tournament, Start date and End date of the tournament will adjust based on rounds automatically. So Start date of the tournament will be earliest start date of the Rounds and End date will be latest.

Once you crated rounds, you can see that above rounds there are 2 buttons - Pencil for editing and Trash can for deleting. 

![Rounds - buttons](https://i.imgur.com/ddl7cOY.png)

![Rounds - editing](https://i.imgur.com/yPqjIm4.png)

Clicking on trash can will ask you, if you want to delete the Round from the database, this action cannot be undone.

As an admin you can edit for the users both hosts and leads in the tournament, if they are ready or not. This feature is not available for teamleaders, because they have to follow the same rules as hosts. So if it needs to be edited, it should be edited by an admin.

### Masteradmin
Masteradmin has not really that many changes. User with this role can delete other users or can promote them to an admin role on **Admin - Users** panel, where admin has no possibility to promote another user to admin role.
