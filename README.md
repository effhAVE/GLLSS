# GLLSS - Global Loot League Staff Scheduler

GLLSS is a web application created to make the life of GLL Staff easier.
It includes many features which are supposed to make spreadsheet usage no longer necessary, automate some processes and open new possibilities.
The list of features can be found [here](#features).

## Backstory
Once I joined GLL team my dear friend Michelle (host lead for GLL) told me about the web app idea which was suggested by one of the employees. She wanted to make it on her own but since she was lacking time and skills needed I offered my help to take over the development. I started right away (5th of March 2020) and after 1.5 month the primary version was ready.
