# GLLSS - Guide

## Introduction
Purpose of the site is to help staff, especially hosts and teamleaders of GLL to make a schedule for them when to work as the main aspect. They can put their availability for certain tournaments and then they can be scheduled. Site also offers more functionalities to ease the work. There are several roles to divide people based on their position. We will look into each role and describe the site, functionalities and possibilities within each role.

## Roles
The site works on the roles principle. There are several roles where next role has something more to access and inherits all the rights from the previous role. Right now there are these roles:
- Uncomfirmed User
- Guest
- Host
- Teamleader
- Admin
- Masteradmin

### Unconfirmed User
First things first, to access the site a person has to register. On the image shown, it can be seen what the login page looks like.

![Login Page](https://i.imgur.com/avUSHKr.png)

Clicking on **Register now**, you will be able to create an account where you need to enter:
* Nickname - which is at least 2 characters long, has to be unique
* Email address - your email address, has to be unique
* Password - has to consist of at least one number, one capital letter and has to be at least 5 characters long

Once you fill all the information and you try to log in, you will see the site does not allow it and would throw an error.

![Verification error](https://i.imgur.com/dqh0bfO.png)

To step up from this, you have to go to your email address and check the email, so you can confirm your account. If you cannot see any email, try looking into trashbin. If you still cannot find it, then you can click on **Need Verification Email?** Email should look like the picture below and you can either click on the button or the link.

![Verification error](https://i.imgur.com/EKkQPSE.png).

Once you click on the button you will become Guest and will be able to log in.

### Guest
As a guest you will be able to log in to the site and see the message saying that before you can continue you have to be confirmed as shown on the picture. 

![Guest Menu](https://i.imgur.com/845Gfd6.png)

The list of current admins is generated by database of users who have admin or masteradmin role. You cannot access any other part of the site. If you try to type something into URL then you will get **Error 403** (meaning access denied), the button for going back will be shown too. If, on the other hand, you would try to type a site which does not exist, you will get an **Error 404**. Until you are confirmed you can only log out by the button on the top right corner.

![Logout](https://i.imgur.com/Xk80OFV.png)

#### Password Reset
If you forget your password you can click on **forgot your password?** from the login screen, you will be asked to type your email address. After that, an email will arrive in the same style as the confirmation email and the link will redirect you to the password reset page. 

![Password Reset Page](https://i.imgur.com/wul4KCY.png)

If you fill it up, you will get a message that the password was changed and you can log in using a new password. 

### Host
Host is a person who is hosting games. From the schedule host knows on which game and when he needs to be here. To become a host, you have to be confirmed by one of the admins. If you had been confirmed, you will have to relog to the page to see the changes. As a host you will finally see a menu of items and we will go through all of them.

![Host Menu Items](https://i.imgur.com/t70H12Q.png)

Whenever you are on any page, you can toggle the menu items by clicking the menu button on top left. 

![Toggle Menu Items](https://i.imgur.com/mcInvZh.png)

#### Hosting Guide
Hosting Guide is a step by step guide for hosts about how to host each game individually. It is a link to a Google document. The plan is to move the guide to be editable onto the page. 

#### Teamkills Script
It is a script which looks at the Teamkill Value of PUBG games through their API. GLL site does not have the teamkills fixed while scoring through API and this is an easy tool to correct the teamkills if there are any. The script will always show the right amount of kills that a person should have, if the person has a teamkill. To make it work you have to paste the full match ID from PUBG and click search. You can alternatively press Enter too.

![TeamKills Script](https://i.imgur.com/jMxJB0j.png)

If you will paste an incorrect or outdated Match ID, error message will appear.

![TeamKills Script Error](https://i.imgur.com/w65Bh10.png)

#### Tournaments - Overview
This is where we start with main functionalities of the site. As the host you want to host specific tournaments, and on this page you have all the upcoming/running tournaments and past tournaments. It looks like in the picture and we will go through each point. 

![Tournament Overview](https://i.imgur.com/92QQtvb.png)

**Active Tournaments** are all the tournaments which did not end yet. They are sorted by default by their start date.
**Past Tournament** are all the tournaments which end time is already in the past. They are sorted by the end time. A tournament which ended most recently will be on top. To show past tournaments click on the button **Show Past tournaments**. By default this button is off.
If you would like to use another sorting, you can order Active or Past tournaments by clicking on the Game/Start date or End date. If you click on Game Tournaments will be ordered the same way, but bundled by game first. 

![Game ordering](https://i.imgur.com/RoZUw4O.png)

By default there are only 15 tournaments shown. To load more, there is a Load more button on the bottom to load 10 more tournaments. 

![Load More Button](https://i.imgur.com/AnNj8DU.png)

Now to specify each of the fields of the tournament
- Available - This is a clickable field to put your availability. If you click it in the tournament, you will put availability for the entire tournament with all the rounds inside. 
- Hosting - This field is not clickable and it will show only if you are selected as a host/teamleader
- Tournament name - This one is a clickable field again and it will redirect you to the tournament itself, which will be specified here, too. 
- Game - Shows a game in which the tournament is held. 
- Start date - It is a start date and time of the tournament. Displayed in your local time.
- End date - It is an end date and time of the tournament. Displayed in your local time.

**Search** field allows you to filter upcoming tournaments. You can either type some string from the tournament or specify the game by typing game name. To see tournaments of one game only, you should click on **Load more** until you can see all the tournaments. Type after the game and you will see only selected games as on picture below.

![Selected View](https://i.imgur.com/p0LZzPW.png)

If you click anywhere except Tournament name on the table row, the tournament row will show its rounds as well and you will be able to see slightly more detailed information of Rounds.

![Rounds in OverView](https://i.imgur.com/PbgmdRh.png)

Rounds displaying consists of:
- Available - Again a clickable field, to put your availability but now only for the specified round.
- Hosting - This field is not clickable and it will show only if you are selected as a host/teamleader for the round.
- Round name - Specifying the name of the round.
- Best of - Shows the number of games which are held within the round, so hosts know how many games they will be hosting.
- Start date - It is a Start date and time of the round. Displayed in your local time.
- End date - It is a End date and time of the round. Displayed in your local time.

There is one more button **Expand All** . Clicking on the button will expand all the tournaments rows. Clicking again will collapse them instead. 

To select availability you have to click on Available fields to choose to your liking what you would like to host. Then you have to confirm the changes. You can then redo the availability any time if you are not selected to hosting, then the second field will be marked and you will be unable to change your availability.

![Availability Changes](https://i.imgur.com/jgGxvDc.png)

Last part will show what it looks like when you are selected for hosting. You can see that the Available field became grey and is not clickable anymore. 

![Selected for Hosting](https://i.imgur.com/fko9dJn.png)

Now we will move to a tournament page. 

#### Tournaments - Specific Tournament 
The tournament page will show more information about the tournament which were not specified in the Tournaments Overview.

![Tournament](https://i.imgur.com/Waq761H.png)

To specify additional fields.
- ID - ID of the tournament, auto-generated, unique
- Series ID - ID of the series tournament belongs to. This is a clickable link which will lead to a series page. Series will be described later.
- Admin Page URL - This is a direct link to the tournament page in admin.gloot.com of the same tournament. The link is to ease the work so you can just click on it to go straight to the tournament at GLL.
- Region - Specifying in which region the tournament is held. 

Second part of the tournaments is its Round View.

![Tournament Round View](https://i.imgur.com/10EeMDk.png)

On the top there is specified name of the round and its start and end dates. Next field **Preparation time** specifies amount of time team leader have to spend to prepare the tournament. Then you can see selected hosts/teamleads and icons next to it. On the bottom there is displayed best of. 
Icons can be:
- Green - Person pressed Ready
- Red - Person did not press Ready
- Orange - Person pressed Ready but the group did not happen, so the host lost hosting 

You can as well see some numbers next to hosts/teamleads. If the numbers are for hosts, it is the additional or revoked rounds for specific Host, so for example in the picture Leodaddy has +4. It means he hosted 2 games and as well 4 more so at the end it is 6 games. 
Then when it comes to Teamleads it is specifying minutes. So Towby lead 60 minutes less then he was supposed to. 

Last part of what you can do as a host on Tournament Page is clicking Ready, which is next to your name. Ready button only displays one hour before the tournament and becomes unavailable 30 minutes before. It is a check-in for hosts to see if they are ready within specific timeframe before the tournament. 

![Not clickable](https://i.imgur.com/LoY4gm4.png) ![Clickable](https://i.imgur.com/zEB21jD.png) ![Clicked](https://i.imgur.com/tPpk9ed.png)

As you can see in the picture, by default the button is grey but if you are within the needed timeframe it will become clickable. Once you click it, you cannot unclick it.

#### Series
Series is a list of all series, which are created. Tournaments of the same series have in common:
- Game
- Partially the name
- Region

![Series Overview](https://i.imgur.com/SGeITAf.png)

As we can see, common things which series inherit are displayed in overview. Additionally, you can see how many tournaments are already in the series, called as Tournaments count. If you click on any of the series, you will go to specified series itself. 

![Specific Series Overview](https://i.imgur.com/ZsMe63o.png)

On the top of the series itself, you can see the series name and then fields:
- Name - Name of the series
- ID - ID of the series
- Game - Game in which series is held
- Region - Region for the series
- Recurrence - can be: 
  - daily - Tournaments are happening several times a week, the name of the tournaments then is generated as `#WN DDD Series Name` - where WN is a Week Number and DDD is the first three letters of the day of the week.
  - weekly - Tournaments happen at most once a week. The name is then generated as follows `#WN Series Name` - where WN is a week number.
 - Start Date - start date and time of the series 
 - End Date - end date and time of the series 
 
You can see here as well **Load Series' Tournaments** button, which will show all the tournaments within the series and clicking on Tournaments will redirect you to the Tournament itself.

![Series Tournaments Overview](https://i.imgur.com/0luFAhO.png)

#### Calendar
Calendar is a week based overview of all the rounds in a compact way, so you have a better overview of the tournaments, rounds and hosting. On the top right the number of the week in the year is shown. You can click on it to choose any week as shown on the picture and it will display the schedule for the chosen week from Monday to Sunday. You have to click on OK once you select a week for change to happen. 

![Calendar chooosing week](https://i.imgur.com/9YLS3Ut.png)

Once you select a week you can choose which type of tournaments you would like to see. You can choose Specific Games or keep it at All. Overview of the rounds per week is separated by games and ordered by UTC start time. To determine on which day the round will display the server is looking into regions and each round is a part of the tournament which is in specific region. Each region has its UTC offset, which is converted then to Tournament Region Local Start Time. It will show for the day in which this Tournament Region Local Start Time begins. It can be seen in picture below. 

![Calendar showing matches](https://i.imgur.com/PE4BjyN.png)

As can be seen it is the compact view where first it displays the Tournament name, where clicking would go to tournament page. There is Round name displayed below. The third row shows your local start time of the tournament and **BO** stands for Best Of to display how many rounds are played. Then it shows Hosts and Teamleads. 
In front of Hosts you can see Group Number depending on the game, so you know which group you are actually hosting. Also, Round Balance or Time Balance is displayed here and you can see in the picture below that Leodaddy has +4 more rounds. Each day per game will have as well its own scrollbar if there are too many rounds in one day.

![Lost Hosting not Displayed](https://i.imgur.com/76V3oIZ.png)

This view does not display Lost hosting as we can see - Maya lost hosting but in Calendar it is not displayed. Calendar only shows people who either did host/lead or are scheduled to host/lead. As the last part to mention in Calendar is whenever you are chosen to host you will be displayed with yellow person icon and yellow text color, to find yourself easier. 

![User Hosting](https://i.imgur.com/GNmprLU.png)

#### Data
This section is to display total values for Hosting/Leading, additional stats per games and more. First, you have to choose in which month you want to look into Data.

![Month Period](https://i.imgur.com/eNvjise.png)

After choosing a month, Data for specific month for a user is shown. To determine which round goes to which month:
It takes into consideration Tournament Round Local Start date and puts it accordingly in that month. Some tournaments have additional property which regulates if the whole tournament is counted by Round Tournament Local Start Time or every round belongs to the month tournaments ends.

Data consist of several Parts:
- Overview
  - User - Display users, where it will show only you, if you are Host/Team Lead.
  - Games Hosted - Number of total Games Hosted per user. Games Hosted are counted as how many rounds a person hosted. Round balance is considered here and added.
  - Host Value - Based on Games Hosted and value per game hosted, total value is calculated. More can be seen on other tabs, this is a total amount of all games hosted together.
  - Teamlead Time - Total amount of time per Teamlead in minutes spent. This is computed based on how much time did leader have to spend when leading a tournament or tournaments. If leading several tournaments at the same time some are excluded since it is looking into possible collisions of times where Time Balance and Preparation Time for Teamleaders is considered. Preparation time is a value for the round in minutes, which teamleader has to prepare before tournament starts. To specify the timeframe, as a first value Preparation Time is taken, then duration of round and in the end Time Balance. Then all timeframes are looked at with possible collision and if there is a collision it is not counted towards total time. 
  - Teamlead Value - It is the total amount of expenses per user for Leading based on Teamlead Time. 
  - Total Value - Sum of the Host value and Teamlead value per user. It is translated as total amount of expenses which person will earn or has earned. 
  
  ![Data Overview](https://i.imgur.com/J54aeFA.png)

- Games Summary - summary per user per specific game, Overview is a sum of all games summaries.
  - User - Display users, where it will show only you, if you are Host/Team Lead.
  - Games Hosted - Number of Games Hosted per user per Game.
  - Host Value - Amount of expenses per user based on Games Hosted multiplied by Game Value.
  - Teamlead Time - Amount of Lead Time per user.
  - Teamlead Value - Amount of expenses per user based on Teamlead Time.
  - Total Value - Sum of the Host value and Teamlead value per user.
  - Game Value - Can be seen on the bottom, it is the multiplier per Game Hosted of the specific Game.
  
  ![Games Summary](https://i.imgur.com/nB5N1N7.png)
    
#### Overview 
The last part for the host is the Overview where the user can see what he/she is going to host or lead. There are some useful links, which are commonly used. 

![Overview](https://i.imgur.com/FGyn3Pa.png)
  
In the **Upcoming tournaments** you can see all the tournaments which are active and you are either hosting or leading. **Starts** shows for both Rounds and Tournament in which time the tournament or round will start. **Role** can be either host or teamlead. **Ready** is the same as in Tournaments. You can click ready from the overview. It follows the same rules as in the Tournament Page.
The default limit of upcoming tournaments is 5 and there is a Load More button if you need to see more tournaments. 

On the top there is a checkbox to Show Past Tournaments. By default it is turned off but if you turn it on you can see simplified version of Past tournaments.   
  
![Past Tournaments](https://i.imgur.com/mB3PfMI.png)

### Teamleader
Teamleader is a role above Host. Teamleader takes care of running tournaments smoothly, preparing them and taking support. There are not many differences between a host and a teamleader when it comes to the application. The main difference is being able to schedule people. Only the changes between hosts and teamleads will be shown. 

![Menu Items](https://i.imgur.com/73LvAyD.png)

#### Overview 
**Useful Links** now contains links for Teamleaders. Teamleaders also have to check-in before a tournament, so even hosts can see that teamleader is ready. 

![Useful Links TL](https://i.imgur.com/LXz3Mgu.png)

#### Tournaments - Specific Tournament 
The first difference in Tournament Page is that teamleaders can add/remove hosts/leads from the rounds. 

![Tournaments - Hosts/TLs](https://i.imgur.com/LoGUli8.png)

As you can see, now it looks a little different. A button on the left to the host with a skull icon will remove the host from the round. Green button will allow you to add a person or a teamleader who selected their availability for the particular tournament. If there is no one available a message "No available hosts" will show or alternatively "No available teamleaders". You can also click on any user which is already selected which allows you to replace him with another user from the availability list. Availability list is ordered alphabetically.

![Tournaments - Hosts/TLs - changes](https://i.imgur.com/PFR2B01.png)

Last thing which is possible here is to click on a pencil icon. Here you can change values for the specific user. Keep in mind editing teamleaders may show you different fields.

![Choosing Hosts](https://i.imgur.com/91rC8XI.png) ![Pencil](https://i.imgur.com/5SBwTlE.png) ![Pencil - TLs](https://i.imgur.com/2JqA3Y4.png)

![Round balance](https://i.imgur.com/ZqrRqMZ.png) ![Lost Hosting](https://i.imgur.com/lCmjn3v.png)

If you do any changes you need to confirm them by pressing a button on bottom right. 

![Confirm changes](https://i.imgur.com/HKzyp4t.png)

When it comes to availability if a host chose that he/she is available then they appear only as available in Hosts, but if a teamleader did it they can be chosen both as a host and as a teamlead but only one at the time. 

Sometimes it can happen that at the end you needed someone who hadn't selected his availability so for the past tournaments you can choose any host/teamleader. 

![Choosing in past Tournaments](https://i.imgur.com/AcR87gx.png)

#### Schedule
This is a new menu item for teamleaders. The purpose of the Schedule is to have a compact way of scheduling people. Overview looks similar to the Calendar but with possibilities as in Tournaments, meaning you can add/remove, edit Round Balance/Time Balance and so on. 

![Schedule Overview](https://i.imgur.com/fItOrX7.png)

You can choose All or any game as you want. Selecting a week has only 3 options and those are Current (default), Previous or Next. It is because when it comes to scheduling those 3 weeks are the most important for changes. Previous week is there to check that everything was done properly but should not have any changes. Current week can change based on hosts needed and Next week is there to schedule people for next week.

![Select week](https://i.imgur.com/G3ktFlW.png)

To determine who is available at which time you can click on a yellow icon on bottom left which will show all the hosts and leads with their availability. Availability will not show if a person is already selected for hosting/leading.

![Availability Table](https://i.imgur.com/uydjs7F.png)

On the top you can see Tournament names, and then Rounds. Hosts/Leads are ordered by alphabetical order. **X** stands for available. Tournaments are ordered in the same way how they are shown on the Schedule page. Availability Table will be displayed based on the week selected. 

The last part in this is another Tab called **Balance** as can be seen in the picture below.

![Balance](https://i.imgur.com/NUIOWlM.png)

Balance is divided into games because hosts are being balanced per game individually. Current week value is computed by how many times a person is selected in the current week and multiplied by Best of in rounds where the person is selected. So if calculation value for Apex is 40 and a Round is Best Of 8, then total value is 8*40 = 320. Rounds of Tournaments which have a property of Counted by Rounds set to false are not counted in this balance. Those tournaments are special and are added as extra.

Lost Hosting is a value where a person lost hosting so he can be compensated. Lost Hosting is only from the previous week. Lost hosting happens if the person was ready but unfortunately the group he was supposed to host did not happen. A teamleader can mark the person who lost hosting by checking lost hosting property and the amount which would be computed goes to the next week as Lost Hosting.

Difference is computed as `Current week value - Lost Hosting (from previous week)`.

### Admin
Admin is a role above the teamlead. It is a user which has more rights and access for changing tournaments, rounds or users. Admin is responsible for correctness of these information before teamleaders and hosts have access to them. Menu items now include Admin panel, which have several subitems.

![Admin ](https://i.imgur.com/PyqxrOb.png)

#### Admin - Confirm Users
On this page you as an admin can confirm new registered user, who are first as a guest. Confirming them will put them a host role. By confirming, you have to select users you want to confirm and then click on **Confirm Selected**. Panel consists of:

You can too demote users back to guest and after, they will not be able to see anything on the page. All of the fields are having again possibility to order by clicking on them, so you can order by role for example.

![Admin - Users - Roles](https://i.imgur.com/PrTHcmF.png)

#### Admin - Create a data month
This panel will allow you to create a new Data month for computing Data. You can click on calendar, select the month you want to create and then hit **Save**. To confirm and create it, you have to hit **Save** again. It will automatically redirect you to Data page after. If you selected month, which is already created, nothing will happen. 

![Admin - Create a data month](https://i.imgur.com/qbgUO0g.png) ![Admin - Create a data month -save](https://i.imgur.com/b85zS4m.png)

#### Admin - Create a series
Here you can create a new series, which will be then added to other series. All the fields will have to be filled. 

![Create a series](https://i.imgur.com/14DNt6Y.png)

- Name - this is the name of the series and all the tournaments will inherit the name if the series will be selected.
- Start Date - Start date of the series in UTC time. By default it will show next full hour of the current date. You can click on it to edit it. 
- End Date - End date of the series in UTC time. By default it will be set to one more year from the start date. You can click on it to edit it, end date has to be later than the start date. 
- Game - List of available games. 
- Region - List of available regions.
- Recurrence - Can be daily or weekly and by choosing one of those 2, names are generated based on different criterias which were already described before, but will be described here too.

When choosing Start or End Date, Calendar will show up, where you have to first choose the date, then it will jump to an hour. Here make sure you are on the correct time by AM or PM on bottom right and left. After hour is selected you can select minutes too. All the time here is displayed in UTC. So you need to take care when you are creating the tournament start and end date. Once you are ok with time, click on **Save**. If it saved, time will be shown on page in UTC time too. 

![Edit - Date](https://i.imgur.com/bcIK8slm.png) ![Edit - Hour](https://i.imgur.com/UwSE1PKm.png) ![Edit - Time](https://i.imgur.com/Oh5EKbwm.png)

Game list is a list of all available games at the moment, to specify it - PUBG, Apex, Autochess, PUBG Mobile.

![List of Games](https://i.imgur.com/PrtMLC5.png)

Recurrence can be either weekly or daily and based on what you choose, then tournaments will be generated as follows:
- daily - Tournaments are happening several times in the week, the name of the tournaments then is generated as `#WN DDD Series Name` - where WN is Week Number and DDD day of the week in at first three letters
- weekly - Tournaments happen at most once a week. The name is then generated as follows `#WN Series Name` - where WN is a week number.

![List of Recurrence](https://i.imgur.com/sSAS6MO.png)

Region is to choose a region in which tournament is held in. Each region has its own UTC Offset too, as an example Americas Region has the UTC offset of value -4 . This offset is really important to determine the tournament and rounds in the tournament, in which counting day they are happening. Even if Americas would start past midnight UTC on Monday, as UTC time would be Tuesday, they will still be displayed in Monday and counted on the date of Monday, because of the offset.

![List of Regions](https://i.imgur.com/PFeehQ2.png)

At the end name has to be specified too. And once all is selected, then as an example this is how the series can be called. Only thing left to do is hitting the **Save** button and you will be redirected to the series page. 

![Series - Example](https://i.imgur.com/wMc15Z2.png)

#### Admin - Create a tournament
Here you can create a new tournament, which will be then added to the other tournaments. All the fields will have to be filled except the Admin Page URL, which does not need to be filled, if the tournament is not yet on admin page, but it is known to happen and official for hosts to be created. Fields work the same as in the Series creation, so only difference will be explained.

![Create a tournament](https://i.imgur.com/GJR7MXf.png)

- Name - This is the name of the tournament. 
- Series - List of the Series. They are ordered by creation, where latest one will be on the bottom. 
- Start Date - Start date of the tournament in UTC time. By default it will show next full hour of the current date. You can click on it to edit it. 
- End Date - End date of the tournament in UTC time. By default it will be set to plus 8 hours from the start date. You can click on it to edit it, end date has to be later than the start date. 
- Game - List of available games. 
- Region - List of available regions.
- Counted by Rounds - This a parameter, which defines if each round of the tournament is counted by Tournament Round Local Start Date or every round will be counted by end time of the tournament. Some tournaments are considered as bigger projects and are paid after the project is finished. This only influences in which month it will count for Data. By default it will be selected, meaning each round will count by Tournament Round Local Start Date.

If you select the Series, then Name, Game and Region will not be possible to edit, because those will be inherited from the series. 

![Admin - Choosing Series](https://i.imgur.com/lAhibps.png)

So as an example of the tournament to be created can look like this in the picture. Only thing which remains after is clicking on **Save** button and you will be redirected to the Overview of Tournaments. 

![Admin - Tournaments example](https://i.imgur.com/cJ43NLL.png)

#### Data
As an admin, you have much more data to be displayed. As you can notice now, both Overview and Games summary displays all the users ordered in alphabetical order.

In Data as an admin you have 2 buttons on the top right: **(Re)Calculate** and **Download Logs**. 

![Admin - Data buttons](https://i.imgur.com/bRPDqXF.png)

Clicking on (Re)Calculate will open a window, where you can edit all the values per game and as well value for Teamleads. Value for Teamleads is the amount of expenses per one hour of work. And amount per Game are costs per 1 Round in specific game. Calculation does not happen automatically, so admin has to recalculate after each week when hosts did change or schedule per week is done. To confirm green button **Calculate** has to be pressed. Calculation can take few seconds.

After you do calculation, you can check the logs by downloading them and you can see step by step, how calculation was done. You can see especially for teamleaders, how are collisions handled. Full explanation was already mentioned in Data part for Hosts, how the stuff is calculated. On the picture you can see small part of the log.

#### Series
In the series now, you will have option to Edit or delete the series. If you will go to series you will see those buttons on the top. 

![Series - buttons](https://i.imgur.com/64ZBZo5.png)

Clicking on **Edit Series** will give you option to edit all the parameters for the series, when you had been creating them. Editing them will not change current series, but all the upcoming tournaments, which will be in that series. As a note, you should not forget, that Times are being edited in UTC time. 

![Series - editing](https://i.imgur.com/RnXegWk.png)

Clicking on delete is only possible if the series have no tournaments in it. Otherwise the option will be grey. If you click on it, you will get one more prompt window, to make sure you want to perform this action. Action cannot be undone and series will be then deleted.

#### Tournaments - Specific Tournament 
In the specific tournaments now, you will have the option to Edit or delete the Tournament similar as in Series, but as well you will have one more button called **Add Round**.

![Tournaments - buttons](https://i.imgur.com/zp65GKa.png)

Clicking on Edit will return you back to editing the tournament. If the tournament is in the series, then you can edit only parameters you could edit, when creating a tournament and choosing a series, but option to rename will be there now. If the tournament is not in the series, you can edit all the fields. Time is here displayed in UTC as in all editing stuff. 

![Tournaments - Edit - Series](https://i.imgur.com/4HBC6Ntm.png) ![Tournaments - Edit - Non Series](https://i.imgur.com/F7fTfAIm.png)

Deleting will now work any time and you will always get a second prompt window before hitting delete button, because this action cannot be undone too.

If tournament has all the correct values then rounds needs to be added into the tournament. Clicking on an **Add Round** button will show another window with these values:
- Name - Name of a round.
- Start Date: Start date of the round in UTC time. By default it will be start date of the tournament.
- End Date: End date of the round in UTC time. By default it will be end date of the tournament.
- Best Of: Amount of rounds played in specific round, basically how many games a host will need to host. 
- Preparation time: This is a required time for TeamLeaders for the round to prepare the tournament before the start. If as an example there would be 30 as 30 minutes, that means that TeamLeader have to be here 30 mins before the start of the tournament to prepare it on the GLL site and as well handle support before. This time is counted for computing the amount of expenses.

If you click on **Save** button, round to the tournament will be added. If you will do new round, then rounds will get sorted by Start time of the rounds, even if you edit the round after, it will automatically sort them by start time. 
By adding round to the tournament, Start date and End date of the tournament will adjust based on the rounds automatically. So Start date of the tournament will be earliest start date of the Rounds and End date will be latest.

Once you create rounds, you can see that above rounds there are 2 buttons - Pencil for editing and Trash can for deleting. 

![Rounds - buttons](https://i.imgur.com/RCWF19y.png)

If you click on a Pencil, you will get editing for round, where you can choose and edit all the properties again. 

![Rounds - editing](https://i.imgur.com/gyZAjPr.png)

Clicking on a Trash can will ask you, if you want to delete the Round from the database, this action cannot be undone.

As an admin you can edit for both hosts and team leaders in the tournament, if they are ready or not. This feature is not available for teamleaders, because they have to follow the same rules as hosts. So if it needs to be edited, it should be edited by an admin only.
